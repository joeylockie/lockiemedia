Random notes:<br>
The game will start out with all but one of the facets closed off (Trammel open and lost lands closed).<br>
Most of the dungeons will be closed, however two starters, one normal and one group dungeons will be open.<br>
Some shops will have their doors locked and npcs de-spawn during the night. However over time the number may increase or decrease. This is done in order to try and create more of a player based economy.<br>
Some animals will spawn only during the day and another during the night.<br>
Users can be hit by lightning when it's raining.<br>
4 UO days take place during one real day (the real calendar is used or dates). - Done<br>
No PvP other than in PvP pits or events.<br>
No player able elf race (at least not for now).<br>
Skill and state limits (to increase with expansions and over time).<br>
No item insurance - Done<br>
Able to bless items (maybe).<br>
Able to buy houses in towns and cities.<br>
Slave jail system.<br>
New players run the banking system and interest system.<br>
Lottery system.<br>
MOTD system with in game link to forum and websites.<br>
Email Register, and same forum/in-game password system.<br>
No player run towns.<br>
In-game/irc/and other (new) chat systems.<br>
NPC's living out lives and what not (Interactive in some cases).<br>
Client patch system.<br>
No champion spawn's (for now). - Done<br>
Some cities have been removed or moved or changed.<br>
No fractions - Done * <br>
FS Daily rares/rares - Done<br>
No power scrolls - Done * <br>
Skill cap 100 (No making it higher though spells or scrolls, for now)<br>
In game forum linking to website forum in order to get rid of uo in game forum<br>
<br>
Now one of the big questions is how the website should look, feel and work.<br>
I would like to have a number of sections: Forum, Server stats, Pay-pal section, IRC chat link, Online in-game and out-of-game items, Downloads and a Wiki.<br>
Most of the news in game and out of the game, patch notes, tutorials and what not will be published on the forums with important information being pushed to the website home page. The wiki will be used for in-game information like maps and in-game guilds/tutorials, spawn lists and quests and what not.<br>
The problem is that I get too many website ideas as I am writing this. I went back and added five sections up to this point so you can see what I am talking about. So in order to make the website smaller I will try to put as much information into the forums in order to make user navigation of information as easy as possible.<br>
<br>
0.1.0.0 we basically want a running server that people can connect to. Basic spawner system will be added. For the most part it will be a standard runuo server. We will start with the runuo version 2.0 final along with the UO client version 6.0.10.0. However all dungeons will be closed and only one facet (Trammel) will be open. A basic spawner system will be added (Nerun's Distro) and we will be using the preset spawns that come with it until later to give the players something to do.
<br><br>
0.2.0.0 This patch will add a large number of systems and underlying systems that will be used to control large parts of the shard as well as most of the future systems we would like to add. Some of the features that will be added are a new spawner system, group dungeon raids, lots more chat options, MOTD system, veteran rewards, better weather, and better world time (night day) this will affect animals spawning and what not. Lottery system, jail system, and much more. One or two starter dungeons will be opened.
<br><br>
0.?.?.? Main and sub quests will be added as well an overall storyline (and background) will be added. With this more dungeons and land will be opened up to players.
<br><br>
0.5.?.? Server will reopen. Characters will be wiped however in order to make players still want to play before this patch goes live, players will be given tokens, rewards and maybe money based on their per-wiped characters skills, levels, items, money and more. The server will reopen along with the new site/network. as well we will start activity advertising the server/network. This patch will come within less then a week after the last patch, maybe even at the same time more or less. With this patch as well a lot more integration with the website and network will be done, like universal passwords (same password between the game and the forums).
<br><br>
0.?.?.? Throughout the process the version of runuo will be slowly upgraded along with the client version in order to fix bugs and what have you. However not all the changes made in the runuo svn will be added due to them not working with custom scripts and changes made to the server.<br>
E.T.A: When ever
<br><br>
1.0.0.0 we will be adding the first major addon pact to the server
<br><br>
2.0.0.0 new facet will open up. large parts of art will be redone
<br><br>
3.0.0.0 third facet will open up
<br><br>
4.0.0.0 no new facet however large parts of the world will be redone
<br><br>
More information will be added as time goes on.
<br><br>
Archaeology/Timeline<br>
World timeline broken into 4 ages.<br>
<br>
Before the age of enlightenment <br>
Maybe other species lived along with humans however after 0ae only humans are left. (some elfs are left but very rare and don't talk about their kind or background). Most Elfs disapire leave no or very little clues. But in reality they moved to another "facet", however some didn't want to leave (maybe 20-30 at most). Most elves who stayed behind now are shopkeepers. a group of dark elves created the ""crystal of power" and a group of good elves created the book of power inorder to balance the world out. After the war the elves made peace and then left the world. Elfs can live up to 1000 years.
<br><br>
The age of enlightenment (0ae - 500ae)<br>
Not much is known about before this time
"ae" means "after enlightenment" This date is used to mark the start of the age of enlightenment. why? Because this is the oldest book found that keeps records and is the starting point of the calendar used. Two magical artifacts have been found from before this item, the "crystal of power" and the "book of rituals". During this time people were just starting to build cities and iron/steel work and magic.
<br><br>
The age of fraction (500ae - 1500ae)<br>
During this time many empires and fractions formed and wars marked this time for close to 5 hundred years. Then for 450 years peace. One of the kingdoms were made up of mostly magic users; they were peaceful mages who used their magic to explore the wonders of the universe. During this time they found the crystal of power no records could be found about it so they started to use it to enhance their magic power but slowly they were corrupted by it.
Then for 50 years magic users teamed up to try and control the world using the "crystal of power".
<br><br>
The age of unifying (1500ae - now (current date 2000ae<br>
One king along with a few good mages defeat the evil magic users (using the "book of rituals") and binded all the empires and fractions into one empire (war lasts 20 years, known as the unifying wars). Due to this the king outlaws magic in less the user is a member of the mages guild. Magic users who practice magic and are not a member of the mages guild are jailed or killed. Due to this mages guild games have a lot of power and influence. The mages guild hunts and locks up all magical artifacts and what not. After the unifying wars and dark mages and their followers who were not killed were banished to another plane (fascet). Current king is the 7th generation from the original king. Current king has two kids 20-30 years or older. King has put both kids in control of one city each to teach them how to rule and run a city. Both kids don't get along with each other so both cities don't like each other as well and may be ready to go to war and attack each other. The current king talks about changing the magic law about only being allowed if part of the magic guild law into allowing anyone to do it even if they aren't part of the magic guild. The Current leader of the church is in favor of this. The current leader of the church is security, an evil mage who has the ear of the king. however the king doesn't know this. The head of the church is trying to bring back the other evil mages but he needs the book of rituals and crystal of power, so he's trying to destroy or weaken the mages guild in order for his agents to steal the two artifacts. Current head of the mages guild is trying to talk the king out of changing the rules however should it fail the mages guild is starting to build an army to overflow the current and maybe put one of his sons in power or someone else who won't change the magic laws. The two brothers have been told whoever is the better ruler of his own people will become king so both brothers do whatever it takes. One is kind of evil and the other a little nicer but not by much. Both build up a strong army in order to try and scare the other one into backing down as the heir.
<br><br>
War breaks out between the two brother cities king decides not to but a stop to it in order to see who wins and puts a stop to it (kind of like a test)
<br><br>
Maybe open or closed war breaks out between the mages guild and the church's evil mages
<br><br>
A church in each city that worship the creator<br>
King rulers entire kingdom kings guards control area in between cities
Each city has a lord that rulers over that city and the surrounding parts
Mages guilds rule all mages and have authority in the entire kingdom. Hq in brit city<br>
Church's in each city, control all the shrines and religious sites<br>
jail in the city no longer used (may be used for quest)<br>
Each city has its own color for its guards and flags and what not(and king as his own as well)<br>
<br>
