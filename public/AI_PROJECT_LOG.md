Last Updated: 2025-06-20 05:03 (EDT) ##

## 1. Instructions for AI (Gemini)
**Purpose of this Document:** This document is your primary source of truth for the Lockie Media Platform project. It provides context, tracks progress, outlines current tasks, and lists future goals. Please refer to it to understand:

* The overall project scope.
* What has already been completed.
* What the user (Joey) is currently working on with your assistance.
* The specific sub-tasks and files involved in the current session.
* Any known issues or important decisions made.

**How to Use & Update This Document:**
* **Prioritize this Document:** When the user provides this document or refers to it at the start of a session, consider its content as the most up-to-date information, potentially overriding previous chat history if there are discrepancies regarding project state.
* **Understand Current Focus:** Pay close attention to Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps from the previous version of this log to understand the immediate objectives for the current session.
* **Track Session Progress:** During our development session, keep track of:
    * Tasks completed and files modified/created.
    * New issues or bugs identified.
    * Key decisions made.
    * The next logical steps or remaining sub-tasks.
* **Generate Updated Log Content (End of Session):**
    * When the user asks you to "update the AI Project Log" (or similar), your task is to regenerate the entire Markdown content for this document.
    * You will use the previous version of this log (provided by the user at the start of the session or from the current context if it's the same session) as your base.
    * Update all relevant sections based on the work done during the session, including:
        * The "Last Updated" timestamp at the top (use the current date and time).
        * Section 4: Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task): Add a new dated entry summarizing the session's accomplishments.
        * Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps: Update this to reflect what the next immediate actions should be. If the current sub-task is complete, define the next one. Clear out old "Specific questions for AI" if answered, or add new ones.
        * Section 6: Known Issues / Bugs: Add any new issues identified.
        * Section 8: Important Notes / Decisions Made: Add any significant decisions.
    * If a major feature part of Section 2 is completed, update its status and summarize in Section 3.
* **Maintain Format:** Preserve the existing Markdown structure and formatting.
* **Provide Complete Output:** Present the entire, fully updated Markdown content back to the user so they can replace the content of their AI_PROJECT_LOG.md file.
* **Avoid Redundancy:** Use the "Work Completed" sections (3 and 4) from the previous log version to avoid re-suggesting solutions or code for tasks already finished before the current session began.

## 2. Project Overview & Goals:
**Platform:** "Lockie Media Platform", which includes user-facing "apps" and administrative "services".

**Vision:** To become an all-in-one platform for personal and business management, comprised of modular apps.

**Technology:** Self-hosted application with a **microservice architecture**. Backend services are built with Node.js/Express.js and a shared SQLite database. Services are managed by **PM2** and fronted by a central **API Gateway** secured with API Keys.

**Core Platform Apps (Initial Focus):** Task Manager, Notes, Habit Tracker, Time Tracker, Pomodoro, and Calendar.

**Overall Goal:** Develop a robust, feature-complete management platform with a suite of integrated apps.

## 3. Work Completed (Overall Project - High Level):
* **Core Task Management:** Functionalities implemented as a foundational module.
* **Backend Refactor:** Migrated from a Firebase backend to a self-hosted Node.js/Express stack.
* **Database Migration:** Successfully migrated the core application's database from `lowdb` (JSON file) to a robust SQLite database using `better-sqlite3`.
* **Feature Streamlining:** Removed several non-core features to simplify the codebase.
* **Client-side Services:** Implemented services for logging, events, view management, etc.
* **Backend Architecture Refactor:** Migrated the backend from a single monolith to a microservice architecture, creating an API Gateway and independent services for Notes, Tasks, and Time Tracking. Implemented PM2 for process management.
* **API Security:** Implemented an API Key authentication layer (`X-API-Key` header) on the API Gateway to protect all backend services.

## 4. Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task):
**Date: 2025-06-20**
* **Task**: Architectural Refactor: Monolith to Microservices & API Security
* **Summary**: Successfully decoupled all core application logic (Notes, Tasks, Time Tracker) from the original monolith into independent microservices. Introduced a central API Gateway to manage and route all API requests, and secured the entire API with a mandatory API Key header.
* **Details**:
    * Installed and configured **PM2** to manage all backend processes.
    * Created an `ecosystem.json` configuration file to define and manage all services (`api-gateway`, `notes-service`, `task-service`, `time-tracker-service`).
    * Created new, independent services for Notes, Tasks, and Time Tracking, each with its own Express server and dependencies.
    * Implemented an **API Composition** pattern in the gateway, where it fetches data from multiple downstream services and combines it into a single response, requiring no initial frontend code changes.
    * Moved all database logic for Notes, Tasks, and Time Tracking out of the original `server.js` and into their respective services.
    * Reduced the original `server.js` to an empty shell, making it redundant for API logic.
    * Implemented an `X-API-Key` authentication middleware on the API Gateway.
    * Updated the frontend `store.js` to send the API key with every request.
    * Troubleshot and resolved numerous configuration issues related to PM2, module systems, `EADDRINUSE` port conflicts, and `RangeError` bugs.u

## 5. Current Focus / Next Steps (Specific to Current Major Task):
**Current Major Task/Feature Being Worked On:**
* **Name:** Solidify New Architecture & Plan Next Feature
* **Goal for this Task:** With the major refactor complete and stable, the next goal is to decide on the next priority, which could be further cleanup, frontend work, or new feature development.
* **Status:** Major refactor complete. Ready for the next phase.

**Current Sub-Task / Immediate Next Action:**
* **Decision Point.** The next step is to choose from the following options:
    1.  **Final Backend Cleanup:** The now-empty `lockiemedia-monolith` service is redundant and can be safely removed from `ecosystem.json` and deleted from the project.
    2.  **Frontend Decoupling:** Begin the process of breaking the monolithic frontend into independent applications, starting with one of the smaller apps like Notes or Time Tracker.
    3.  **New Feature Development:** Begin building a new feature (e.g., Reminders) on top of the new, stable architecture.

* **Specific questions for AI (if any):**
    * None.
* **Blockers (if any):**
    * None.

## 6. Known Issues / Bugs (Related to current work or recently discovered):
* None. All known bugs from the refactoring session have been resolved.

## 7. Future/Pending Work (Overall Project - High Level):
* **Backend Migration**: Complete.
* **Security**: Further enhancements could include JWT for user-level authentication in the future.
* **Frontend Decoupling**: A major pending task is to break the frontend into independent apps.
* **Core Features**: Refine and enhance core features based on usage.
* **UI/UX**: Continuously improve the user interface and experience across all apps.

## 8. Important Notes / Decisions Made:
* **Feature Streamlining**: A decision was made to remove several complex or non-core features to simplify the application's focus and codebase.
* **Database Migration Complete & Successful:** The decision to move to SQLite was made to support the user's goal of heavy, 24/7 data logging.
* **Microservice Architecture Adopted**: Pivoted from a simple data centralization task to a full backend refactor. Adopted a microservice architecture with an API Gateway to ensure true decoupling, improve stability, and provide a secure foundation for future third-party integrations. Implemented API Key security as the first layer of protection.
