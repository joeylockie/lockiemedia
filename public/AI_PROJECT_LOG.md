Instructions for AI (Gemini)
Purpose of this Document: This document is your primary source of truth for the Lockie Media Platform project. It provides context, tracks progress, outlines current tasks, and lists future goals. Please refer to it to understand:

The overall project scope.

What has already been completed.

What the user (Joey) is currently working on with your assistance.

The specific sub-tasks and files involved in the current session.

Any known issues or important decisions made.

How to Use & Update This Document: * Prioritize this Document: When the user provides this document or refers to it at the start of a session, consider its content as the most up-to-date information, potentially overriding previous chat history if there are discrepancies regarding project state.

Understand Current Focus: Pay close attention to Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps from the previous version of this log to understand the immediate objectives for the current session.
Track Session Progress: During our development session, keep track of:
Tasks completed and files modified/created.
New issues or bugs identified.
Key decisions made.
The next logical steps or remaining sub-tasks.
Generate Updated Log Content (End of Session):
When the user asks you to "update the AI Project Log" (or similar), your task is to regenerate the entire Markdown content for this document.
You will use the previous version of this log (provided by the user at the start of the session or from the current context if it's the same session) as your base.
Update all relevant sections based on the work done during the session, including:
The "Last Updated" timestamp at the top (use the current date and time).
Section 4: Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task): Add a new dated entry summarizing the session's accomplishments.
Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps: Update this to reflect what the next immediate actions should be. If the current sub-task is complete, define the next one. Clear out old "Specific questions for AI" if answered, or add new ones.
Section 6: Known Issues / Bugs: Add any new issues identified.
Section 8: Important Notes / Decisions Made: Add any significant decisions.
If a major feature part of Section 2 is completed, update its status and summarize in Section 3.
Maintain Format: Preserve the existing Markdown structure and formatting.
Provide Complete Output: Present the entire, fully updated Markdown content back to the user so they can replace the content of their AI_PROJECT_LOG.md file.
Avoid Redundancy: Use the "Work Completed" sections (3 and 4) from the previous log version to avoid re-suggesting solutions or code for tasks already finished before the current session began.

1. Project Overview & Goals:
Platform: "Lockie Media Platform", which includes user-facing "apps" and administrative "services".

Vision: To become an all-in-one platform for personal and business management, comprised of modular apps and services.

Technology: Self-hosted client-side application (HTML, CSS, JS) with a Node.js/Express.js backend and `lowdb` file-based database.

Core Platform Apps (Initial Focus): Task Manager, Notes, Habit Tracker, Time Tracker, Pomodoro, and Calendar.

Core Platform Services: The Admin Panel (admin.html) and Ad Admin (advertising_admin.html) provide insights, monitoring, and administrative capabilities for the platform's apps.

Overall Goal: Develop a robust, feature-complete management platform with a suite of integrated apps and administrative services for monitoring and management.

2. Current Major Task/Feature Being Worked On:
Name: Major Feature Removal and Refactoring

Goal for this Task: To streamline the platform by removing a significant number of non-core or planned features from the main `todo.html` application. This involves deleting feature files and cleaning up all references in the remaining codebase.

Status: In Progress

3. Work Completed (Overall Project - High Level):
Lockie Media Platform (Apps):

Core task management functionalities implemented as a foundational module.

Refactored from a Firebase backend to a self-hosted Node.js/Express/lowdb stack.

Client-side error logging to the console via `loggingService.js`.

Modular architecture with services for logging, events, view management, tasks, projects, labels, etc.

Functional, client-side implementations for Notes, Habit Tracker, and Time Tracker using localStorage.

Advanced Recurrence Feature: Fully implemented with custom intervals, specific day selection for weeks, and end dates.

Shopping List Feature: Fully implemented as a new Smart View.

Admin Panel (Service):

Initial setup and core features for a static admin panel.

Advertising System (Service):

A basic internal advertising system implemented using localStorage.

4. Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task):
Date: 2025-06-18

Began a major refactoring to remove a large number of features from the platform to simplify the codebase.
Edited the following files to remove code related to deleted features: `main.js`, `todo.html`, `ui_rendering.js`, `ui_event_handlers.js`, `modalEventHandlers.js`, `taskService.js`, `dashboard_main.js`, `dashboard.html`, `style.css`, `viewManager.js`, `README.md`.

5. Current Focus / Next Steps (Specific to Current Major Task):
Current Sub-Task: Finalize the feature removal.

Immediate Next Action: Identify and delete all JavaScript files for the removed features. Update this project log to reflect the new, leaner state of the project.

Specific questions for AI (if any):

None.

Blockers (if any):

None.

6. Known Issues / Bugs (Related to current work or recently discovered):
None.

7. Future/Pending Work (Overall Project - High Level):
Admin Panel (Service):

Flesh out the Admin Panel with more statistics and monitoring tools relevant to the self-hosted environment.

Lockie Media Platform (Apps):

Refine the core remaining features (Tasks, Notes, Habits, etc.).
Integrate the localStorage-based apps (Notes, Habits, Time Tracker) with the `lowdb` backend for unified data storage.

8. Important Notes / Decisions Made:
Project Refactoring: A significant number of features were removed to simplify the platform and focus on core functionality. Removed features include Kanban view, Calendar view (from todo app), Pomodoro timer (from todo app), tooltips, task timer integration, and several planned/placeholder features.

Backend Change: The entire platform was previously refactored from a Firebase backend to a self-hosted Node.js server with a `lowdb` JSON file database. All user authentication has been removed, making it a single-user platform.
