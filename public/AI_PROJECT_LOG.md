Last Updated: 2025-06-19 01:47 (EDT) ##

## 1. Instructions for AI (Gemini)
**Purpose of this Document:** This document is your primary source of truth for the Lockie Media Platform project. It provides context, tracks progress, outlines current tasks, and lists future goals. Please refer to it to understand:

* The overall project scope.
* What has already been completed.
* What the user (Joey) is currently working on with your assistance.
* The specific sub-tasks and files involved in the current session.
* Any known issues or important decisions made.

**How to Use & Update This Document:**
* **Prioritize this Document:** When the user provides this document or refers to it at the start of a session, consider its content as the most up-to-date information, potentially overriding previous chat history if there are discrepancies regarding project state.
* **Understand Current Focus:** Pay close attention to Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps from the previous version of this log to understand the immediate objectives for the current session.
* **Track Session Progress:** During our development session, keep track of:
    * Tasks completed and files modified/created.
    * New issues or bugs identified.
    * Key decisions made.
    * The next logical steps or remaining sub-tasks.
* **Generate Updated Log Content (End of Session):**
    * When the user asks you to "update the AI Project Log" (or similar), your task is to regenerate the entire Markdown content for this document.
    * You will use the previous version of this log (provided by the user at the start of the session or from the current context if it's the same session) as your base.
    * Update all relevant sections based on the work done during the session, including:
        * The "Last Updated" timestamp at the top (use the current date and time).
        * Section 4: Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task): Add a new dated entry summarizing the session's accomplishments.
        * Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps: Update this to reflect what the next immediate actions should be. If the current sub-task is complete, define the next one. Clear out old "Specific questions for AI" if answered, or add new ones.
        * Section 6: Known Issues / Bugs: Add any new issues identified.
        * Section 8: Important Notes / Decisions Made: Add any significant decisions.
    * If a major feature part of Section 2 is completed, update its status and summarize in Section 3.
* **Maintain Format:** Preserve the existing Markdown structure and formatting.
* **Provide Complete Output:** Present the entire, fully updated Markdown content back to the user so they can replace the content of their AI_PROJECT_LOG.md file.
* **Avoid Redundancy:** Use the "Work Completed" sections (3 and 4) from the previous log version to avoid re-suggesting solutions or code for tasks already finished before the current session began.

## 2. Project Overview & Goals:
**Platform:** "Lockie Media Platform", which includes user-facing "apps" and administrative "services".

**Vision:** To become an all-in-one platform for personal and business management, comprised of modular apps.

**Technology:** Self-hosted client-side application (HTML, CSS, JS) with a Node.js/Express.js backend and an SQLite database.

**Core Platform Apps (Initial Focus):** Task Manager, Notes, Habit Tracker, Time Tracker, Pomodoro, and Calendar.

**Overall Goal:** Develop a robust, feature-complete management platform with a suite of integrated apps.

## 3. Work Completed (Overall Project - High Level):
* **Core Task Management:** Functionalities implemented as a foundational module.
* **Backend Refactor:** Migrated from a Firebase backend to a self-hosted Node.js/Express stack.
* **Database Migration:** Successfully migrated the core application's database from `lowdb` (JSON file) to a robust SQLite database using `better-sqlite3`.
* **Feature Streamlining:** Removed several non-core and administrative features to simplify the codebase and focus on the main productivity tools. This included the Admin Panel, Ads System, Sub-tasks, Dependencies, Attachments, Data Versioning, and Data Export.
* **Client-side Services:** Implemented services for logging, events, view management, tasks, projects, labels, etc.
* **App Implementations:** Functional, client-side implementations for Notes, Habit Tracker, and Time Tracker are in place (originally using localStorage, pending migration to SQLite).
* **Advanced Recurrence Feature:** Fully implemented with custom intervals, specific day selection for weeks, and end dates.
* **Shopping List Feature:** Fully implemented as a new Smart View in the Task Manager.

## 4. Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task):
**Date: 2025-06-19**
* **Task**: Streamline Platform Features.
* **Summary**: Completed a major refactoring to remove several features from the platform to focus the application on its core productivity purpose.
* **Details**:
    * Removed all UI elements for Sub-tasks, Dependencies, Attachments, Data Versioning, and Data Export from the Task Manager modals (`todo.html`).
    * Removed Admin Panel and Advertising System links and UI from the `dashboard.html`.
    * Updated the database schema (`database-setup.js`) to remove columns related to the deleted features from the `tasks` table.
    * Modified `server.js` to align with the new, simpler database schema.
    * Updated all relevant frontend JavaScript modules (`main.js`, `taskService.js`, `ui_rendering.js`, `modal_interactions.js`, etc.) to remove the logic, imports, and event handlers for the deleted features.
    * Identified and fixed several 404 (Not Found) errors caused by leftover imports of deleted JavaScript files.
    * Deleted all unused feature-specific JavaScript files from the `/public` directory.

**Date: 2025-06-18**
* **Task**: Migrate Core Backend to SQLite.
* **Summary**: Completed the full migration of the core application's backend from `lowdb` to SQLite.
* **Details**:
    * Installed `better-sqlite3` and removed `lowdb` dependencies.
    * Created a `database-setup.js` script to define and initialize the new database schema (`lockiedb.sqlite`).
    * Overhauled `server.js` to handle API requests using the SQLite database, while maintaining the existing API contract with the frontend.
    * Simplified `public/store.js` to remove data conversion logic now handled by the server.
    * Successfully tested all core application features (add, edit, complete, delete tasks) with the new database.
    * Updated project documentation (`README.md` and `AI_PROJECT_LOG.md`) to reflect the new architecture.

## 5. Current Focus / Next Steps (Specific to Current Major Task):
**Current Major Task/Feature Being Worked On:**
* **Name:** Centralize Remaining App Data into SQLite
* **Goal for this Task:** To migrate the remaining client-side apps (Notes, Habit Tracker, Time Tracker) that currently use localStorage to use the new centralized SQLite backend. This will unify all application data, improve persistence, and enable more complex features.
* **Status:** Not Started

**Current Sub-Task:**
* Begin migration of the **Notes App**.

**Immediate Next Action:**
1.  **Analyze** `noteService.js` and `feature_notes.js` to understand the current localStorage implementation.
2.  **Update `server.js`** to add new API routes/logic within the existing `/api/data` endpoints to handle getting and saving notes and notebooks from the SQLite database.
3.  **Refactor `noteService.js`** to call the backend API for all data operations instead of using localStorage.
4.  **Test** the Notes app thoroughly to ensure all features work with the new backend.

* **Specific questions for AI (if any):**
    * None.
* **Blockers (if any):**
    * None.

## 6. Known Issues / Bugs (Related to current work or recently discovered):
* None.

## 7. Future/Pending Work (Overall Project - High Level):
* **Backend Migration**: Continue migrating the Habits and Time Tracker apps to the SQLite backend.
* **Core Features**: Refine and enhance the core remaining features based on usage.
* **UI/UX**: Continuously improve the user interface and experience across all apps.

## 8. Important Notes / Decisions Made:
* **Feature Streamlining**: A decision was made to remove several complex or non-core features (Admin Panel, Ads, Sub-tasks, Dependencies, etc.) to simplify the application's focus and codebase. This allows for a more robust and maintainable core product.
* **Database Migration Complete & Successful:** The decision to move to SQLite was made to support the user's goal of heavy, 24/7 data logging. This provides significant improvements in performance, scalability, and data integrity over the previous `lowdb` implementation.
