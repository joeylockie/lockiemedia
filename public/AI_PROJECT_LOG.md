**Last Updated:** 2025-07-20 20:33 (EDT)


## 1. Instructions for AI (Gemini)

**Purpose of this Document:** A Note to AI Assistants: This document is your primary source of truth for the Lockie Media Platform project. It provides context, tracks progress, outlines current tasks, and lists future goals. Please refer to it to understand:

* The overall project scope.
* What has already been completed.
* What the user is currently working on with your assistance.
* The specific sub-tasks and files involved in the current session.
* Any known issues or important decisions made.

**How to Use & Update This Document:**

* **Prioritize this Document:** When the user provides this document or refers to it at the start of a session, consider its content as the most up-to-date information, potentially overriding previous chat history if there are discrepancies regarding project state.
* **Understand Current Focus:** Pay close attention to Section 6: "Current Focus / Next Steps" from the previous version of this log to understand the immediate objectives for the current session.
* **Track Session Progress:** During our development session, keep track of:
    * Tasks completed and files modified/created.
    * New issues or bugs identified.
    * Key decisions made.
    * The next logical steps or remaining sub-tasks.
* **Generate Updated Log Content (End of Session):**
    * When the user asks you to "update the AI Project Log" (or similar), your task is to regenerate the entire Markdown content for this document.
    * You will use the previous version of this log as your base.
    * Update all relevant sections based on the work done during the session, including the "Last Updated" timestamp, "Work Completed," "Current Focus," and "Known Issues."
    * Maintain Format: Preserve the existing Markdown structure and formatting.
    * Provide Complete Output: Present the entire, fully updated Markdown content back to the user so they can replace the content of their `AI_PROJECT_LOG.md` file.

## 4. Work Completed (Overall Project - High Level)

* **Architecture Migration:** Migrated the entire platform from a self-hosted Node.js microservice architecture to a purely client-side application using browser local storage.
* **Core Task Management:** Functionalities implemented as a foundational module.
* **Backend Refactor (Legacy):** Migrated from a Firebase backend to a self-hosted Node.js/Express stack.
* **Database Migration (Legacy):** Successfully migrated the core application's database from lowdb (JSON file) to a robust SQLite database using `better-sqlite3`.
* **Backend Architecture Refactor (Legacy):** Migrated the backend from a single monolith to a microservice architecture.
* **Notes App Enhancements:** Added notebook deletion and a full-featured Markdown editor.
* **Time Tracker UI/UX Enhancements:** Fixed critical dark mode UI bugs and implemented a fully-featured custom reminder system.
* **Calendar App Enhancements:** Implemented a full-featured Week View with drag-and-drop and a live time indicator.

## 5. Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task)

* **Date:** 2025-07-20
* **Task:** Refactor Project to a Client-Side Application.
* **Goal:** Remove the entire backend, eliminate the database, and refactor the application to store all data in the browser's local storage. This simplifies the architecture, removes hosting costs, and makes the app easily deployable on any static web host (like GitHub Pages).
* **Sub-tasks Completed:**
    * **File Deletion:** Removed all backend files (`server.js`, `package.json`, `ecosystem.json`, etc.), the entire `/services` directory, and all files related to the deleted Pomodoro and Dev-Tracker apps.
    * **Data Layer Refactor (`store.js`):** Completely rewrote the core data store. Replaced all `fetch` API calls with direct calls to `localStorage.setItem()` and `localStorage.getItem()`, effectively making the browser the database.
    * **Service Logic Refactor:**
        * Updated `habitTrackerService.js` to manage habits and completions locally via the new `AppStore`.
        * Updated `taskService.js`, preserving its advanced date parsing and recurrence logic, to manage tasks locally.
        * Updated `timeTrackerService.js` to remove `async/await` and manage time logs and activities locally.
        * Verified `noteService.js` was already compliant with the new local architecture.
    * **UI/Dashboard Cleanup:**
        * Updated `dashboard_main.js` to remove the link to the deleted Pomodoro app.
        * Replaced the server-dependent "Download Backup" function with a new client-side function that exports all data from local storage into a single `.json` file.
    * **Documentation Update:**
        * Updated the `README.md` to reflect the new, simpler client-side architecture.
        * Updated this `AI_PROJECT_LOG.md` to document the entire refactoring process.

## 9. Important Notes / Decisions Made

* **PIVOTAL DECISION: Migration to Client-Side Architecture:** The project has been fundamentally changed from a complex, self-hosted Node.js microservice application to a pure client-side application. This decision was made to drastically simplify the architecture, eliminate server hosting and maintenance costs, and enable easy deployment on any static hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify). All application data now resides exclusively in the user's browser local storage.
* **Data Backup Strategy:** The backup strategy has been changed. The "Download Backup" button now generates a `.json` file containing all application data directly from the user's browser. This replaces the previous server-side database backup.
* **Legacy Architecture (Historical Context):** The previous microservice architecture, API gateway, and SQLite database are now considered legacy parts of the project's history. They were crucial development steps but have been superseded by the new client-side approach.
* **Editor Choice:** A side-by-side Markdown editor (using Marked.js and DOMPurify) with toggleable view modes was chosen for the Notes app over a more complex Rich Text/WYSIWYG editor. This decision prioritized implementation speed, maintainability, and data portability (plain text) while still providing a powerful user experience.
We have now completed all the steps. Your project is fully refactored, and all your documentation is
