AI Project Curation Log: Lockie Media Platform
Last Updated: 2025-06-18 21:01 (EDT) ##

Instructions for AI (Gemini)
Purpose of this Document: This document is your primary source of truth for the Lockie Media Platform project. It provides context, tracks progress, outlines current tasks, and lists future goals. Please refer to it to understand:

The overall project scope.

What has already been completed.

What the user (Joey) is currently working on with your assistance.

The specific sub-tasks and files involved in the current session.

Any known issues or important decisions made.

How to Use & Update This Document: * Prioritize this Document: When the user provides this document or refers to it at the start of a session, consider its content as the most up-to-date information, potentially overriding previous chat history if there are discrepancies regarding project state.

Understand Current Focus: Pay close attention to Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps from the previous version of this log to understand the immediate objectives for the current session.
Track Session Progress: During our development session, keep track of:
Tasks completed and files modified/created.
New issues or bugs identified.
Key decisions made.
The next logical steps or remaining sub-tasks.
Generate Updated Log Content (End of Session):
When the user asks you to "update the AI Project Log" (or similar), your task is to regenerate the entire Markdown content for this document.
You will use the previous version of this log (provided by the user at the start of the session or from the current context if it's the same session) as your base.
Update all relevant sections based on the work done during the session, including:
The "Last Updated" timestamp at the top (use the current date and time).
Section 4: Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task): Add a new dated entry summarizing the session's accomplishments.
Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps: Update this to reflect what the next immediate actions should be. If the current sub-task is complete, define the next one. Clear out old "Specific questions for AI" if answered, or add new ones.
Section 6: Known Issues / Bugs: Add any new issues identified.
Section 8: Important Notes / Decisions Made: Add any significant decisions.
If a major feature part of Section 2 is completed, update its status and summarize in Section 3.
Maintain Format: Preserve the existing Markdown structure and formatting.
Provide Complete Output: Present the entire, fully updated Markdown content back to the user so they can replace the content of their AI_PROJECT_LOG.md file.
Avoid Redundancy: Use the "Work Completed" sections (3 and 4) from the previous log version to avoid re-suggesting solutions or code for tasks already finished before the current session began.

Project Overview & Goals:
Platform: "Lockie Media Platform", which includes user-facing "apps" and administrative "services".

Vision: To become an all-in-one platform for personal and business management, comprised of modular apps and services.

Technology: Self-hosted client-side application (HTML, CSS, JS) with a Node.js/Express.js backend and an SQLite database.

Core Platform Apps (Initial Focus): Task Manager, Notes, Habit Tracker, Time Tracker, Pomodoro, and Calendar.

Core Platform Services: The Admin Panel (admin.html) and Ad Admin (advertising_admin.html) provide insights, monitoring, and administrative capabilities for the platform's apps.

Overall Goal: Develop a robust, feature-complete management platform with a suite of integrated apps and administrative services for monitoring and management.

Current Major Task/Feature Being Worked On:
Name: Centralize App Data into SQLite

Goal for this Task: To migrate the remaining client-side apps (Notes, Habit Tracker, Time Tracker) that use localStorage to use the new centralized SQLite backend. This will unify all application data, improve persistence, and enable more complex features.

Status: Not Started

Work Completed (Overall Project - High Level):
Lockie Media Platform (Apps):

Core task management functionalities implemented as a foundational module.

Refactored from a Firebase backend to a self-hosted Node.js/Express stack.

Successfully migrated the core application's database from lowdb (JSON file) to a robust SQLite database.

Client-side error logging to the console via loggingService.js.

Modular architecture with services for logging, events, view management, tasks, projects, labels, etc.

Functional, client-side implementations for Notes, Habit Tracker, and Time Tracker using localStorage.

Advanced Recurrence Feature: Fully implemented with custom intervals, specific day selection for weeks, and end dates.

Shopping List Feature: Fully implemented as a new Smart View.

Admin Panel (Service):

Initial setup and core features for a static admin panel.

Advertising System (Service):

A basic internal advertising system implemented using localStorage.

Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task):
Date: 2025-06-18

Completed the full migration of the core application's backend from lowdb to SQLite.
Installed better-sqlite3 and removed lowdb dependencies.
Created a database-setup.js script to define and initialize the new database schema (lockiedb.sqlite).
Overhauled server.js to handle API requests using the SQLite database, while maintaining the existing API contract with the frontend.
Simplified public/store.js to remove data conversion logic now handled by the server.
Successfully tested all core application features (add, edit, complete, delete tasks) with the new database.
Synchronized all changes with the GitHub repository, including adding the new Personal Access Token for authentication.
Updated project documentation (README.md and AI_PROJECT_LOG.md) to reflect the new architecture.

Current Focus / Next Steps (Specific to Current Major Task):
Current Sub-Task: Begin migration of the Notes App.

Immediate Next Action:

Analyze noteService.js and feature_notes.js.

Modify server.js to include API endpoints for getting, adding, updating, and deleting notes from the SQLite database.

Update the database-setup.js script to include a notes and notebooks table.

Refactor noteService.js to call the new backend APIs instead of using localStorage.

Specific questions for AI (if any):

None.

Blockers (if any):

None.

Known Issues / Bugs (Related to current work or recently discovered):
None.

Future/Pending Work (Overall Project - High Level):
Admin Panel (Service):

Flesh out the Admin Panel with more statistics and monitoring tools relevant to the self-hosted environment, pulling data from the SQLite DB.

Lockie Media Platform (Apps):

Continue migrating Habits and Time Tracker apps to the SQLite backend.
Refine the core remaining features.

Important Notes / Decisions Made:
Database Migration Complete & Successful: The decision to move to SQLite was made to support the user's goal of heavy, 24/7 data logging. This provides significant improvements in performance, scalability, and data integrity over the previous lowdb implementation.
