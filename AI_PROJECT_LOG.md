**Last Updated:** 2025-07-20 22:43 (EDT)


## 1. Instructions for AI (Gemini)

**Purpose of this Document:** A Note to AI Assistants: This document is your primary source of truth for the Lockie Media Platform project. It provides context, tracks progress, outlines current tasks, and lists future goals. Please refer to it to understand:

* The overall project scope.
* What has already been completed.
* What the user is currently working on with your assistance.
* The specific sub-tasks and files involved in the current session.
* Any known issues or important decisions made.

**How to Use & Update This Document:**

* **Prioritize this Document:** When the user provides this document or refers to it at the start of a session, consider its content as the most up-to-date information, potentially overriding previous chat history if there are discrepancies regarding project state.
* **Understand Current Focus:** Pay close attention to Section 6: "Current Focus / Next Steps" from the previous version of this log to understand the immediate objectives for the current session.
* **Track Session Progress:** During our development session, keep track of:
    * Tasks completed and files modified/created.
    * New issues or bugs identified.
    * Key decisions made.
    * The next logical steps or remaining sub-tasks.
* **Generate Updated Log Content (End of Session):**
    * When the user asks you to "update the AI Project Log" (or similar), your task is to regenerate the entire Markdown content for this document.
    * You will use the previous version of this log as your base.
    * Update all relevant sections based on the work done during the session, including the "Last Updated" timestamp, "Work Completed," "Current Focus," and "Known Issues."
    * Maintain Format: Preserve the existing Markdown structure and formatting.
    * Provide Complete Output: Present the entire, fully updated Markdown content back to the user so they can replace the content of their `AI_PROJECT_LOG.md` file.

## 4. Work Completed (Overall Project - High Level)

* **Architecture Migration:** Migrated the entire platform from a self-hosted Node.js microservice architecture to a purely client-side application.
* **Data Layer Migration:** Upgraded the data storage from `localStorage` to a robust **IndexedDB** database using the Dexie.js library, including a seamless, one-time data migration for existing users.
* **File Structure Simplification:** Flattened the project structure by moving all files from the `/public` directory to the root, preparing it for simple static hosting.
* **Core Task Management:** Functionalities implemented as a foundational module.
* **Notes App Enhancements:** Added notebook deletion and a full-featured Markdown editor.
* **Calendar App Enhancements:** Implemented a full-featured Week View with drag-and-drop and a live time indicator.

## 5. Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task)

* **Date:** 2025-07-20
* **Task:** Migrate Data Storage from `localStorage` to IndexedDB.
* **Goal:** To upgrade the application's data layer to a more scalable, efficient, and resilient database solution while preserving all existing user data.
* **Sub-tasks Completed:**
    * **Library Integration:** Added the Dexie.js library to `index.html`.
    * **Database Schema:** Created a new `database.js` file to define all application tables (`tasks`, `notes`, `projects`, etc.) and their indexes.
    * **Store Refactor (`store.js`):**
        * Completely rewrote the `store.js` file to interact with the new IndexedDB database.
        * Implemented a one-time, automatic migration function to safely transfer all existing user data from `localStorage` to IndexedDB.
        * Refactored the "setter" methods to be more efficient, acting as cache refreshers rather than database writers.
    * **Service Logic Refactor:**
        * Updated all service files (`taskService.js`, `noteService.js`, `habitTrackerService.js`, `timeTrackerService.js`, `projectService.js`, `labelService.js`, `calendarService.js`) to be `async`.
        * Replaced all data manipulation logic with direct, efficient database commands using Dexie.js.
        * Ensured UI updates are still triggered correctly through the `AppStore` after each database operation.
    * **Documentation Update:** Updated the `README.md` and this `AI_PROJECT_LOG.md` to reflect the new IndexedDB architecture.

## 8. Future/Pending Work (Overall Project - High Level)

* **Data Management:** Implement a data import/restore feature to load data from a `.json` backup file.
* **Security:** Future enhancements could include adding an optional encryption layer before saving to IndexedDB.
* **UI/UX:** Continuously improve the user interface and experience across all apps.
* **automation.html** To be built out at a future date.
* **budget.html** To be built out at a future date.

## 9. Important Notes / Decisions Made

* **Data Layer Upgrade to IndexedDB:** The application's data persistence layer has been upgraded from `localStorage` to IndexedDB (via the Dexie.js library). This was done to provide a more scalable, performant, and resilient data storage solution capable of handling larger amounts of data and more complex queries.
* **PIVOTAL DECISION: Migration to Client-Side Architecture:** The project has been fundamentally changed from a complex, self-hosted Node.js microservice application to a pure client-side application. This decision was made to drastically simplify the architecture, eliminate server hosting and maintenance costs, and enable easy deployment on any static hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify).
* **File Structure:** The project's file structure has been flattened, with all necessary files moved to the root directory to simplify deployment on static hosting services.
* **Data Backup Strategy:** The backup strategy remains a client-side `.json` file export, generated from the data in the AppStore cache.
