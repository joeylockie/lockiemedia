# AI Project Curation Log: Lockie Media Platform

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-20 20:50 (EDT)


## 1. Instructions for AI (Gemini)

**Purpose of this Document:** A Note to AI Assistants: This document is your primary source of truth for the Lockie Media Platform project. It provides context, tracks progress, outlines current tasks, and lists future goals. Please refer to it to understand:

* The overall project scope.
* What has already been completed.
* What the user is currently working on with your assistance.
* The specific sub-tasks and files involved in the current session.
* Any known issues or important decisions made.

**How to Use & Update This Document:**

* **Prioritize this Document:** When the user provides this document or refers to it at the start of a session, consider its content as the most up-to-date information, potentially overriding previous chat history if there are discrepancies regarding project state.
* **Understand Current Focus:** Pay close attention to Section 6: "Current Focus / Next Steps" from the previous version of this log to understand the immediate objectives for the current session.
* **Track Session Progress:** During our development session, keep track of:
    * Tasks completed and files modified/created.
    * New issues or bugs identified.
    * Key decisions made.
    * The next logical steps or remaining sub-tasks.
* **Generate Updated Log Content (End of Session):**
    * When the user asks you to "update the AI Project Log" (or similar), your task is to regenerate the entire Markdown content for this document.
    * You will use the previous version of this log as your base.
    * Update all relevant sections based on the work done during the session, including the "Last Updated" timestamp, "Work Completed," "Current Focus," and "Known Issues."
    * Maintain Format: Preserve the existing Markdown structure and formatting.
    * Provide Complete Output: Present the entire, fully updated Markdown content back to the user so they can replace the content of their `AI_PROJECT_LOG.md` file.

## 4. Work Completed (Overall Project - High Level)

* **Architecture Migration:** Migrated the entire platform from a self-hosted Node.js microservice architecture to a purely client-side application using browser local storage.
* **File Structure Simplification:** Flattened the project structure by moving all files from the `/public` directory to the root, preparing it for simple static hosting.
* **Core Task Management:** Functionalities implemented as a foundational module.
* **Notes App Enhancements:** Added notebook deletion and a full-featured Markdown editor.
* **Calendar App Enhancements:** Implemented a full-featured Week View with drag-and-drop and a live time indicator.

## 5. Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task)

* **Date:** 2025-07-20
* **Task:** Refactor Project to a Client-Side Application & Simplify File Structure.
* **Goal:** Remove the entire backend, eliminate the database, refactor the application to store all data in local storage, and simplify the file structure for easy static hosting.
* **Sub-tasks Completed:**
    * **File Deletion:** Removed all backend files (`server.js`, `package.json`, etc.), the entire `/services` directory, `.gitignore`, and all files related to the deleted Pomodoro and Dev-Tracker apps.
    * **Data Layer Refactor (`store.js`):** Completely rewrote the core data store. Replaced all `fetch` API calls with direct calls to `localStorage.setItem()` and `localStorage.getItem()`.
    * **Service Logic Refactor:** Updated `habitTrackerService.js`, `taskService.js`, and `timeTrackerService.js` to manage all data locally via the new `AppStore`.
    * **UI/Dashboard Cleanup:** Updated `dashboard_main.js` to remove the link to the deleted Pomodoro app and replace the server backup function with a client-side JSON export.
    * **File Structure Flattening:** Moved all files and folders from the `/public` directory to the root project directory and deleted the now-empty `/public` folder.
    * **Documentation Update:** Updated the `README.md` and this `AI_PROJECT_LOG.md` to reflect the new, simplified client-side architecture and file structure.

## 9. Important Notes / Decisions Made

* **PIVOTAL DECISION: Migration to Client-Side Architecture:** The project has been fundamentally changed from a complex, self-hosted Node.js microservice application to a pure client-side application. This decision was made to drastically simplify the architecture, eliminate server hosting and maintenance costs, and enable easy deployment on any static hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify). All application data now resides exclusively in the user's browser local storage.
* **File Structure:** The project's file structure has been flattened, with all necessary files moved to the root directory to simplify deployment on static hosting services. The `public` directory has been removed.
* **Data Backup Strategy:** The backup strategy has been changed. The "Download Backup" button now generates a `.json` file containing all application data directly from the user's browser.
* **Legacy Architecture (Historical Context):** The previous microservice architecture, API gateway, and SQLite database are now considered legacy parts of the project's history. They were crucial development steps but have been superseded by the new client-side approach.
* **Editor Choice:** A side-by-side Markdown editor (using Marked.js and DOMPur
