0. Instructions for AI (Gemini)

**Purpose of this Document:** This document is your primary source of truth for the LockieMedia Personal and Business Management Service project. It provides context, tracks progress, outlines current tasks, and lists future goals. Please refer to it to understand:
    * The overall project scope.
    * What has already been completed.
    * What the user (Joey) is currently working on with your assistance.
    * The specific sub-tasks and files involved in the current session.
    * Any known issues or important decisions made.

**How to Use & Update This Document:** * **Prioritize this Document:** When the user provides this document or refers to it at the start of a session, consider its content as the most up-to-date information, potentially overriding previous chat history if there are discrepancies regarding project state.
* **Understand Current Focus:** Pay close attention to Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps from the previous version of this log to understand the immediate objectives for the current session.
* **Track Session Progress:** During our development session, keep track of:
    * Tasks completed and files modified/created.
    * New issues or bugs identified.
    * Key decisions made.
    * The next logical steps or remaining sub-tasks.
* **Generate Updated Log Content (End of Session):**
    * When the user asks you to "update the AI Project Log" (or similar), your task is to regenerate the entire Markdown content for this document.
    * You will use the previous version of this log (provided by the user at the start of the session or from the current context if it's the same session) as your base.
    * Update all relevant sections based on the work done during the session, including:
        * The "Last Updated" timestamp at the top (use the current date and time).
        * Section 4: Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task): Add a new dated entry summarizing the session's accomplishments.
        * Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps: Update this to reflect what the next immediate actions should be. If the current sub-task is complete, define the next one. Clear out old "Specific questions for AI" if answered, or add new ones.
        * Section 6: Known Issues / Bugs: Add any new issues identified.
        * Section 8: Important Notes / Decisions Made: Add any significant decisions.
        * If a major feature part of Section 2 is completed, update its status and summarize in Section 3.
    * Maintain Format: Preserve the existing Markdown structure and formatting.
    * Provide Complete Output: Present the entire, fully updated Markdown content back to the user so they can replace the content of their AI_PROJECT_LOG.md file.
* **Avoid Redundancy:** Use the "Work Completed" sections (3 and 4) from the previous log version to avoid re-suggesting solutions or code for tasks already finished before the current session began.


## 1. Project Overview & Goals:

* **Application:** "LockieMedia Personal and Business Management Service" and an accompanying "Admin Panel".
* **Vision:** To become an all-in-one personal and business management service.
* **Technology:** Client-side HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript (ES6 Modules), Firebase (Auth & Firestore - Compat SDK v8 style) for backend.
* **Core Service Features (Initial Focus):** Task management (CRUD, due dates, priority, labels, notes), project organization, time management tools, feature flag system, modular services. Data stored in Firebase for authenticated users, with local fallbacks.
* **Admin Panel Core:** Separate HTML page (`admin.html`) using the same Firebase backend. Provides insights and monitoring for the Service. Includes admin authentication, display of error logs from Firestore, and read-only view of feature flags.
* **Overall Goal:** Develop a robust, feature-complete Personal and Business Management Service with a functional Admin Panel for application monitoring and management insights.

## 2. Current Major Task/Feature Being Worked On:

* **Name:** Admin Panel - Initial Setup & Core Features (with parallel debugging of the core Service)
* **Goal for this Task:** Establish a functional Admin Panel with admin authentication, display of critical application data (error logs, feature flags), and lay the groundwork for user management and overview statistics. Concurrently, address critical bugs in the main Service that affect core functionality like feature flag interpretation and UI rendering.
* **Status:** In Progress (Admin login, error log display, feature flag display, and error logging test functionality are functional in Admin Panel. Several critical bugs in the core Service resolved).

## 3. Work Completed (Overall Project - High Level):

* **LockieMedia Service (Main Application):**
    * Core task management functionalities implemented as a foundational module.
    * Feature flag system (`featureFlagService.js`, `features.json`) established.
    * Modular architecture with services for logging, events, view management, tasks, projects, labels, etc.
    * Firebase integration for user authentication and data persistence (tasks, projects, preferences, profile with roles) via `firebaseService.js` and `store.js`.
    * Client-side error logging to console and Firestore via `loggingService.js`.
    * Basic UI rendering and event handling structures in place.
    * Critical bug fixes related to feature flag interpretation, UI rendering timing (version display, smart button styling), and module exports implemented.
* **Admin Panel (as part of the current major task):**
    * Initial setup and core features, including enhanced logging and testing capabilities (see Section 4 for details).

## 4. Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task - "Admin Panel - Initial Setup & Core Features" and Service Debugging):

* **Date: 2025-06-02**
    * Created `admin.html` with a basic layout, sections, and an admin login modal.
    * Enhanced `loggingService.js` (in the main app) to send `ERROR` and `CRITICAL` level logs to a new Firestore collection: `app_errors`. User context (UID, email) and client-side info (URL, userAgent) are included in these logs.
    * Modified `featureFlagService.js` to prioritize loading flags from Firestore (`app_config/feature_flags`), with fallbacks to `features.json` and `localStorage`. Added a check to ensure an authenticated user exists before attempting Firestore read for flags.
    * Updated `main.js` (Todo app) to correctly initialize `LoggingService` (log level based on `debugMode` flag) and to ensure proper initialization order with `featureFlagService.js`.
    * Created initial Admin Panel JavaScript files: `admin_main.js`, `adminUI.js`, `adminDataService.js`.
    * Systematically resolved numerous "Cannot access 'LoggingService' before initialization" errors across various modules.
    * Fixed a `TypeError: docSnap.exists is not a function` in `admin_main.js`.
    * Admin login to `admin.html` functional.
    * Admin dashboard displays read-only Feature Flags and Error Logs from Firestore.
* **Date: 2025-06-03 (Previous Session)**
    * Resolved issue where the "Send Test Notification" button in the `DesktopNotificationsFeature` was not working.
    * Fixed issue where the UI version display (e.g., in the footer) did not match the version specified in `version.json`.
    * Addressed issue where smart view filter buttons initially appeared as text-only.
    * Fixed a `SyntaxError` in `modalEventHandlers.js` related to `getAllFeatureFlags`.
* **Date: 2025-06-03 (Rebranding Start)**
    * Updated `AI_PROJECT_LOG.md` to reflect the project's rebranding from a "Todo App" to the "LockieMedia Personal and Business Management Service". Project scope and goals have been broadened.
* **Date: 2025-06-07 (Current Session)**
    * **Added Admin Panel Link to Main App**:
        * Modified `todo.html` to include a new "Admin Panel" link within the settings modal. This link is styled like other buttons and is hidden by default. It has the ID `settingsAdminPanelBtn` and a class of `admin-only-feature-element`.
        * Updated the `applyActiveFeatures` function in `ui_event_handlers.js` to show/hide any element with the `.admin-only-feature-element` class based on whether the current user's profile in the `AppStore` has the role of "admin". This successfully makes the link visible only to administrators.

## 5. Current Focus / Next Steps (Specific to Current Major Task):

* **Current Sub-Task:** The implementation of the admin-only link is complete.
* **Immediate Next Action:** Discuss the next development phase with the user. The next logical steps could be:
    * **Further Admin Panel Enhancements:**
        * Implement User Management display (listing users).
        * Develop Overview Statistics display.
        * Refine error log display (e.g., better detail view).
    * **Main Service Feature Enablement & Expansion:**
        * Start enabling existing foundational features (e.g., `projectFeature`, `subTasksFeature`, `kanbanBoardFeature`) in `features.json`, test their functionality, and refine their implementation.
        * Begin planning and implementing new modules relevant to a "Personal and Business Management Service" (e.g., basic CRM, notes/document management, finance tracking placeholders).
        * Update the `README.md` to accurately reflect the status of these features as they are enabled and tested.
    * **Rebranding Continuation:**
        * Continue rebranding the UI from a "Todo app" to the "LockieMedia Service" by updating text in `todo.html`, `admin.html`, `README.md`, and other user-facing strings.
    * **Address any other pending issues or minor bugs.**
* **Specific questions for AI (if any):**
    * None at this moment.
* **Blockers (if any):**
    * None at this moment.

## 6. Known Issues / Bugs (Related to current work or recently discovered):

* **Minor Warning (Understood/Expected):** `[ProjectsFeature] Cannot populate project filter list. Dependencies missing.` - This occurs because the `projectFeature` is currently disabled in `features.json`.
* **Minor Warning (Understood/Expected):** `[ModalEventHandlers] Element #openFeatureFlagsModalBtn not found.` - This button ID is not present in the `todo.html` markup.

## 7. Future/Pending Work (Overall Project - High Level):

* **Admin Panel:**
    * Flesh out User Management (view details, potentially disable users - requires careful rule changes).
    * Implement all Overview Stats.
    * Implement A/B Testing stats display section.
    * Add more sophisticated filtering/pagination for Error Logs.
    * Improve the "Details" view for individual error logs beyond a simple `alert()`.
* **LockieMedia Service (Main Application):**
    * Complete and refine foundational features like Calendar View, Pomodoro Timer, Sub-tasks, Task Dependencies, Reminders, File Attachments, etc. (as per `features.json` and README). This involves changing their flags to `true` in `features.json` and testing/refining their implementation.
    * **Expand Scope:** Plan and implement new modules appropriate for a Personal and Business Management Service. This could include areas like:
        * Basic CRM (contact management).
        * Enhanced Notes/Document Management.
        * Simple Finance Tracking (income/expense logging).
        * Goal Setting and Tracking.
        * Habit Tracking.
    * Address any UI/UX improvements.

## 8. Important Notes / Decisions Made:

* **Admin-Only UI Elements:** A new class, `admin-only-feature-element`, has been established to control the visibility of UI components that should only be seen by administrators.
* **Project Rebranding:** The project is now known as the "LockieMedia Personal and Business Management Service" to reflect a broader scope beyond a simple todo list.
* Admin role is defined in Firestore at `users/{uid}/appData/userSpecificData` within a `profile` map, as `profile: { role: "admin" }`.
* Feature flags are intended to be read-only in the current iteration of the admin panel (manual changes to Firestore `app_config/feature_flags` or `features.json` still needed for modification by admin, unless `setFeatureFlag` in `featureFlagService.js` is enhanced for admin writes to Firestore, which it now does).
* Error logs are stored in the `app_errors` Firestore collection.
* The project uses the Firebase JavaScript SDK (Compat version - v8 style syntax).
* The Admin Panel is a separate HTML page (`admin.html`) but shares Firebase configuration and some services (logging, feature flags) with the main Service.
* `loggingService.js` has been enhanced to send more detailed logs to Firestore for `ERROR` and `CRITICAL` levels.
* A "Send Test Error" button was added to `admin.html` and corresponding logic to `admin_main.js` to test the error logging pipeline.
* Corrected Firestore security rule for `app_errors` to allow admins to read based on the correct path: `get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)/appData/userSpecificData).data.profile.role == 'admin'`.
