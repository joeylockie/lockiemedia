Instructions for AI (Gemini)
Purpose of this Document: This document is your primary source of truth for the Lockie Media Platform project. It provides context, tracks progress, outlines current tasks, and lists future goals. Please refer to it to understand:

The overall project scope.

What has already been completed.

What the user (Joey) is currently working on with your assistance.

The specific sub-tasks and files involved in the current session.

Any known issues or important decisions made.

How to Use & Update This Document: * Prioritize this Document: When the user provides this document or refers to it at the start of a session, consider its content as the most up-to-date information, potentially overriding previous chat history if there are discrepancies regarding project state.

Understand Current Focus: Pay close attention to Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps from the previous version of this log to understand the immediate objectives for the current session.
Track Session Progress: During our development session, keep track of:
Tasks completed and files modified/created.
New issues or bugs identified.
Key decisions made.
The next logical steps or remaining sub-tasks.
Generate Updated Log Content (End of Session):
When the user asks you to "update the AI Project Log" (or similar), your task is to regenerate the entire Markdown content for this document.
You will use the previous version of this log (provided by the user at the start of the session or from the current context if it's the same session) as your base.
Update all relevant sections based on the work done during the session, including:
The "Last Updated" timestamp at the top (use the current date and time).
Section 4: Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task): Add a new dated entry summarizing the session's accomplishments.
Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps: Update this to reflect what the next immediate actions should be. If the current sub-task is complete, define the next one. Clear out old "Specific questions for AI" if answered, or add new ones.
Section 6: Known Issues / Bugs: Add any new issues identified.
Section 8: Important Notes / Decisions Made: Add any significant decisions.
If a major feature part of Section 2 is completed, update its status and summarize in Section 3.
Maintain Format: Preserve the existing Markdown structure and formatting.
Provide Complete Output: Present the entire, fully updated Markdown content back to the user so they can replace the content of their AI_PROJECT_LOG.md file.
Avoid Redundancy: Use the "Work Completed" sections (3 and 4) from the previous log version to avoid re-suggesting solutions or code for tasks already finished before the current session began.

1. Project Overview & Goals:
Platform: "Lockie Media Platform", which includes user-facing "apps" and administrative "services".

Vision: To become an all-in-one platform for personal and business management, comprised of modular apps and services.

Technology: Client-side HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript (ES6 Modules), Firebase (Auth & Firestore - Compat SDK v8 style) for backend.

Core Platform Apps (Initial Focus): Task Manager, Notes, Habit Tracker, Time Tracker, Pomodoro, Calendar, and Budget Planner. The core architecture supports these apps with a feature flag system and modular services. Data is stored in Firebase for authenticated users, with local fallbacks.

Core Platform Services: The Admin Panel (admin.html), Ad Admin (advertising_admin.html), and Automation services provide insights, monitoring, and administrative capabilities for the platform's apps.

Overall Goal: Develop a robust, feature-complete management platform with a suite of integrated apps and administrative services for monitoring and management.

2. Current Major Task/Feature Being Worked On:
Name: Internal Advertising System - Phase 1

Goal for this Task: Create a basic, internal advertising system that can be triggered from a dedicated admin page and displayed on public-facing pages, using localStorage for persistence.

Status: Completed

3. Work Completed (Overall Project - High Level):
Lockie Media Platform (Apps):

Core task management functionalities implemented as a foundational module.

Feature flag system (featureFlagService.js, features.json) established.

Modular architecture with services for logging, events, view management, tasks, projects, labels, etc.

Firebase integration for user authentication and data persistence (tasks, projects, preferences, profile with roles) via firebaseService.js and store.js.

Client-side error logging to console and Firestore via loggingService.js.

Critical bug fixes related to feature flag interpretation, UI rendering timing (version display, smart button styling), and module exports implemented.

Performance logging implemented to capture and send app load times to Firestore.

Advanced Recurrence Feature: Fully implemented with custom intervals, specific day selection for weeks, and end dates.

Shopping List Feature: Fully implemented as a new Smart View.

Functional, client-side implementations for Notes, Habit Tracker, and Time Tracker using localStorage.

Admin Panel (Service):

Initial setup and core features, including enhanced logging and testing capabilities.

Key metric widgets are now functional, including Avg. Load Time and API Errors (1hr).

Advertising System (Service):

A new, basic internal advertising system has been implemented using localStorage.

4. Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task):
Date: 2025-06-02

Created admin.html and foundational Admin Panel JavaScript files.

Enhanced loggingService.js to send ERROR and CRITICAL logs to Firestore.

Implemented functional Admin login and display of Feature Flags and Error Logs.

Date: 2025-06-03

Resolved multiple bugs related to UI rendering and feature flag interpretation in the main service.

Updated AI_PROJECT_LOG.md to reflect the project's rebranding.

Date: 2025-06-07

Implemented "Avg. Load Time" and "API Errors (1hr)" widgets in the Admin Panel.

Date: 2025-06-08

Implemented the Advanced Recurrence feature and the new "Shopping List" feature.

Date: 2025-06-14 (Previous Session)

Scaffolded placeholder pages for new features (habits.html, notes.html, time-tracker.html).

Implemented the client-side logic and UI for the Time Tracker and Habit Tracker pages.

Date: 2025-06-14 (Current Session)

Created a new Advertising Admin page (advertising_admin.html).

Created a new service (advertisingService.js) to handle ad logic using localStorage.

Implemented the main script for the ad admin page (advertising_admin_main.js) to trigger a test ad.

Created a display script (ad_display.js) for public pages to listen for and show the ad popup.

Modified index.html to include the ad popup container and a link to the new Advertising Admin page.

5. Current Focus / Next Steps (Specific to Current Major Task):
Current Sub-Task: The basic advertising system is functional. The next step is to make it more dynamic.

Immediate Next Action: Enhance the Advertising Admin page.

Instead of just a "Trigger Test Ad" button, add a form that allows an admin to input the ad's Title, Content, and Image URL.

Upon form submission, this custom ad data should be saved to localStorage and displayed on the index.html page.

Specific questions for AI (if any):

None.

Blockers (if any):

None.

6. Known Issues / Bugs (Related to current work or recently discovered):
Potential Setup Step: The queries for performance metrics and error counts in the admin panel rely on a composite index in Firestore. The first time the admin panel is loaded, an error message may appear in the browser console with a link to create the necessary index in the Firebase Console. This is expected behavior.

7. Future/Pending Work (Overall Project - High Level):
Admin Panel (Service):

Flesh out User Management (view details, potentially disable users - requires careful rule changes).

Implement all Overview Stats.

Implement A/B Testing stats display section.

Lockie Media Platform (Apps):

Complete and refine other foundational features like Calendar View, Pomodoro Timer, Sub-tasks, Task Dependencies, Reminders, File Attachments, etc.

Integrate the new features (Notes, Habits, Time Tracker) with Firebase for cloud persistence for authenticated users.

Expand Scope: Plan and implement new apps and services appropriate for a management platform.

Advertising System (Service):

Integrate the system with Firestore to manage and serve ads to authenticated users.

Develop a system for scheduling and targeting ad campaigns.

8. Important Notes / Decisions Made:
Recurrence Logic: Decided to use the "template" model for recurring tasks.

"API Error Rate" Re-scoped: The widget was changed to "API Errors (1hr)" to show a raw count of recent errors.

Performance Metrics: A new performance_metrics collection has been introduced in Firestore.

Admin-only UI Elements: A new class, admin-only-feature-element, has been established.

Project Rebranding: The project is now known as the "Lockie Media Platform". The user-facing components (Task Manager, Notes, etc.) are referred to as "apps", while administrative components (Admin Panel, Ad Admin) are "services".

Admin role is defined in Firestore at users/{uid}/appData/userSpecificData.

Advertising System V1: The initial version of the advertising system will use localStorage for simplicity. It leverages the storage event to allow for real-time triggering of ads on one page from another.
