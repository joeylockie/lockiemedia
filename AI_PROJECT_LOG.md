Instructions for AI (Gemini)
Purpose of this Document: This document is your primary source of truth for the LockieMedia Personal and Business Management Service project. It provides context, tracks progress, outlines current tasks, and lists future goals. Please refer to it to understand:
* The overall project scope.
* What has already been completed.
* What the user (Joey) is currently working on with your assistance.
* The specific sub-tasks and files involved in the current session.
* Any known issues or important decisions made.

How to Use & Update This Document: * Prioritize this Document: When the user provides this document or refers to it at the start of a session, consider its content as the most up-to-date information, potentially overriding previous chat history if there are discrepancies regarding project state.

Understand Current Focus: Pay close attention to Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps from the previous version of this log to understand the immediate objectives for the current session.
Track Session Progress: During our development session, keep track of:
Tasks completed and files modified/created.
New issues or bugs identified.
Key decisions made.
The next logical steps or remaining sub-tasks.
Generate Updated Log Content (End of Session):
When the user asks you to "update the AI Project Log" (or similar), your task is to regenerate the entire Markdown content for this document.
You will use the previous version of this log (provided by the user at the start of the session or from the current context if it's the same session) as your base.
Update all relevant sections based on the work done during the session, including:
The "Last Updated" timestamp at the top (use the current date and time).
Section 4: Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task): Add a new dated entry summarizing the session's accomplishments.
Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps: Update this to reflect what the next immediate actions should be. If the current sub-task is complete, define the next one. Clear out old "Specific questions for AI" if answered, or add new ones.
Section 6: Known Issues / Bugs: Add any new issues identified.
Section 8: Important Notes / Decisions Made: Add any significant decisions.
If a major feature part of Section 2 is completed, update its status and summarize in Section 3.
Maintain Format: Preserve the existing Markdown structure and formatting.
Provide Complete Output: Present the entire, fully updated Markdown content back to the user so they can replace the content of their AI_PROJECT_LOG.md file.
Avoid Redundancy: Use the "Work Completed" sections (3 and 4) from the previous log version to avoid re-suggesting solutions or code for tasks already finished before the current session began.
1. Project Overview & Goals:
Application: "LockieMedia Personal and Business Management Service" and an accompanying "Admin Panel".
Vision: To become an all-in-one personal and business management service.
Technology: Client-side HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript (ES6 Modules), Firebase (Auth & Firestore - Compat SDK v8 style) for backend.
Core Service Features (Initial Focus): Task management (CRUD, due dates, priority, labels, notes), project organization, time management tools, feature flag system, modular services. Data stored in Firebase for authenticated users, with local fallbacks.
Admin Panel Core: Separate HTML page (admin.html) using the same Firebase backend. Provides insights and monitoring for the Service. Includes admin authentication, display of error logs from Firestore, and read-only view of feature flags.
Overall Goal: Develop a robust, feature-complete Personal and Business Management Service with a functional Admin Panel for application monitoring and management insights.
2. Current Major Task/Feature Being Worked On:
Name: Main Service - Feature Implementation
Goal for this Task: Begin implementing and enabling core service features that were previously placeholders, starting with the advancedRecurrence feature.
Status: In Progress (Phase 1 of advancedRecurrence is complete).
3. Work Completed (Overall Project - High Level):
LockieMedia Service (Main Application):
Core task management functionalities implemented as a foundational module.
Feature flag system (featureFlagService.js, features.json) established.
Modular architecture with services for logging, events, view management, tasks, projects, labels, etc.
Firebase integration for user authentication and data persistence (tasks, projects, preferences, profile with roles) via firebaseService.js and store.js.
Client-side error logging to console and Firestore via loggingService.js.
Basic UI rendering and event handling structures in place.
Critical bug fixes related to feature flag interpretation, UI rendering timing (version display, smart button styling), and module exports implemented.
Performance logging implemented to capture and send app load times to Firestore.
Admin Panel:
Initial setup and core features, including enhanced logging and testing capabilities.
Key metric widgets are now functional, including Avg. Load Time and API Errors (1hr).
Advanced Recurrence Feature:
Phase 1 (MVP) is complete. Basic daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly recurrence is now functional.
4. Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task):
Date: 2025-06-02
Created admin.html with a basic layout, sections, and an admin login modal.
Enhanced loggingService.js (in the main app) to send ERROR and CRITICAL level logs to a new Firestore collection: app_errors. User context (UID, email) and client-side info (URL, userAgent) are included in these logs.
Modified featureFlagService.js to prioritize loading flags from Firestore (app_config/feature_flags), with fallbacks to features.json and localStorage. Added a check to ensure an authenticated user exists before attempting Firestore read for flags.
Updated main.js (Todo app) to correctly initialize LoggingService (log level based on debugMode flag) and to ensure proper initialization order with featureFlagService.js.
Created initial Admin Panel JavaScript files: admin_main.js, adminUI.js, adminDataService.js.
Systematically resolved numerous "Cannot access 'LoggingService' before initialization" errors across various modules.
Fixed a TypeError: docSnap.exists is not a function in admin_main.js.
Admin login to admin.html functional.
Admin dashboard displays read-only Feature Flags and Error Logs from Firestore.
Date: 2025-06-03 (Previous Session)
Resolved issue where the "Send Test Notification" button in the DesktopNotificationsFeature was not working.
Fixed issue where the UI version display (e.g., in the footer) did not match the version specified in version.json.
Addressed issue where smart view filter buttons initially appeared as text-only.
Fixed a SyntaxError in modalEventHandlers.js related to getAllFeatureFlags.
Date: 2025-06-03 (Rebranding Start)
Updated AI_PROJECT_LOG.md to reflect the project's rebranding from a "Todo App" to the "LockieMedia Personal and Business Management Service". Project scope and goals have been broadened.
Date: 2025-06-07 (Previous Session)
Implemented "Avg. Load Time" Widget: Created performanceService.js, modified main.js to send metrics to performance_metrics collection, and updated admin panel to display the average.
Implemented "API Error Rate" Widget (Re-scoped): Re-scoped to "API Errors (1hr)", updated adminDataService.js to fetch recent error counts, and updated the admin UI.
Date: 2025-06-08 (Current Session)
Implemented Phase 1 of Advanced Recurrence:
Enabled the "advancedRecurrence": true flag in features.json.
Added a "Repeats" dropdown menu to the Add and Edit task modals in todo.html.
Updated taskService.js to handle the new recurrence property on task objects.
Implemented the core logic in taskService.js's toggleTaskComplete function to automatically "renew" a task with a future due date upon completion, based on daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly rules.
Updated formEventHandlers.js to read the selected recurrence value from the modal forms.
Updated modal_interactions.js to correctly populate and reset the recurrence dropdown when modals are opened.
5. Current Focus / Next Steps (Specific to Current Major Task):
Current Sub-Task: Phase 1 of the advancedRecurrence feature is complete.
Immediate Next Action: Begin Phase 2 of Advanced Recurrence.
Goal: Enhance the feature to support more complex scheduling.
UI Changes:
In todo.html, when "Weekly" is selected in the recurrence dropdown, dynamically show a set of checkboxes for the days of the week (M, T, W, T, F, S, S).
In todo.html, add an "Every" [number] input field next to the frequency dropdown (e.g., "Every [ 2 ] weeks").
Logic Changes:
In taskService.js, update the nextDueDate calculation logic within toggleTaskComplete to handle these new parameters (interval and daysOfWeek). This will require more complex date manipulation.
Data Structure Changes:
The recurrence object in a task will now store these additional properties (e.g., { frequency: 'weekly', interval: 2, daysOfWeek: ['mo', 'fr'] }).
Specific questions for AI (if any):
None at this moment.
Blockers (if any):
None at this moment.
6. Known Issues / Bugs (Related to current work or recently discovered):
Potential Setup Step: The queries for performance metrics and error counts in the admin panel rely on a composite index in Firestore. The first time the admin panel is loaded, an error message may appear in the browser console with a link to create the necessary index in the Firebase Console. This is expected behavior.
Minor Warning (Understood/Expected): [ProjectsFeature] Cannot populate project filter list. Dependencies missing. - This occurs because the projectFeature is currently disabled in features.json.
Minor Warning (Understood/Expected): [ModalEventHandlers] Element #openFeatureFlagsModalBtn not found. - This button ID is not present in the todo.html markup.
7. Future/Pending Work (Overall Project - High Level):
Advanced Recurrence - Phase 3: Implement end conditions (ending on a specific date or after a number of occurrences).
Admin Panel:
Flesh out User Management (view details, potentially disable users - requires careful rule changes).
Implement all Overview Stats.
Implement A/B Testing stats display section.
Improve the "Details" view for individual error logs beyond a simple alert().
LockieMedia Service (Main Application):
Complete and refine other foundational features like Calendar View, Pomodoro Timer, Sub-tasks, Task Dependencies, Reminders, File Attachments, etc. (as per features.json and README). This involves changing their flags to true in features.json and testing/refining their implementation.
Expand Scope: Plan and implement new modules appropriate for a Personal and Business Management Service. This could include areas like:
Basic CRM (contact management).
Enhanced Notes/Document Management.
Simple Finance Tracking (income/expense logging).
Goal Setting and Tracking.
Habit Tracking.
Address any UI/UX improvements.
8. Important Notes / Decisions Made:
Recurrence Logic: Decided to use the "template" model for recurring tasks. When a recurring task is completed, it is not archived but instead has its due date advanced and its completed status reset to false. This keeps the task list clean and avoids database bloat.
"API Error Rate" Re-scoped: The widget was changed to "API Errors (1hr)" to show a raw count of recent errors. This was more feasible than calculating a true "rate," which would require logging every successful API call.
Performance Metrics: A new performance_metrics collection has been introduced in Firestore to store application load time data.
Admin-Only UI Elements: A new class, admin-only-feature-element, has been established to control the visibility of UI components that should only be seen by administrators.
Project Rebranding: The project is now known as the "LockieMedia Personal and Business Management Service" to reflect a broader scope beyond a simple todo list.
Admin role is defined in Firestore at users/{uid}/appData/userSpecificData within a profile map, as profile: { role: "admin" }.
Feature flags are intended to be read-only in the current iteration of the admin panel (manual changes to Firestore app_config/feature_flags or features.json still needed for modification by admin, unless setFeatureFlag in featureFlagService.js is enhanced for admin writes to Firestore, which it now does).
Error logs are stored in the app_errors Firestore collection.
The project uses the Firebase JavaScript SDK (Compat version - v8 style syntax).
The Admin Panel is a separate HTML page (admin.html) but shares Firebase configuration and some services (logging, feature flags) with the main Service.
loggingService.js has been enhanced to send more detailed logs to Firestore for ERROR and CRITICAL levels.
A "Send Test Error" button was added to admin.html and corresponding logic to admin_main.js to test the error logging pipeline.
Corrected Firestore security rule for app_errors to allow admins to read based on the correct path: get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)/appData/userSpecificData).data.profile.role == 'admin'.
