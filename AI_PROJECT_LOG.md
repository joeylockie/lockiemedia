0. Instructions for AI (Gemini)

**Purpose of this Document:** This document is your primary source of truth for the LockieMedia Todo App & Admin Panel project. It provides context, tracks progress, outlines current tasks, and lists future goals. Please refer to it to understand:
    * The overall project scope.
    * What has already been completed.
    * What the user (Joey) is currently working on with your assistance.
    * The specific sub-tasks and files involved in the current session.
    * Any known issues or important decisions made.

**How to Use & Update This Document:** * **Prioritize this Document:** When the user provides this document or refers to it at the start of a session, consider its content as the most up-to-date information, potentially overriding previous chat history if there are discrepancies regarding project state.
* **Understand Current Focus:** Pay close attention to Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps from the previous version of this log to understand the immediate objectives for the current session.
* **Track Session Progress:** During our development session, keep track of:
    * Tasks completed and files modified/created.
    * New issues or bugs identified.
    * Key decisions made.
    * The next logical steps or remaining sub-tasks.
* **Generate Updated Log Content (End of Session):**
    * When the user asks you to "update the AI Project Log" (or similar), your task is to regenerate the entire Markdown content for this document.
    * You will use the previous version of this log (provided by the user at the start of the session or from the current context if it's the same session) as your base.
    * Update all relevant sections based on the work done during the session, including:
        * The "Last Updated" timestamp at the top (use the current date and time).
        * Section 4: Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task): Add a new dated entry summarizing the session's accomplishments.
        * Section 5: Current Focus / Next Steps: Update this to reflect what the next immediate actions should be. If the current sub-task is complete, define the next one. Clear out old "Specific questions for AI" if answered, or add new ones.
        * Section 6: Known Issues / Bugs: Add any new issues identified.
        * Section 8: Important Notes / Decisions Made: Add any significant decisions.
        * If a major feature part of Section 2 is completed, update its status and summarize in Section 3.
    * Maintain Format: Preserve the existing Markdown structure and formatting.
    * Provide Complete Output: Present the entire, fully updated Markdown content back to the user so they can replace the content of their AI_PROJECT_LOG.md file.
* **Avoid Redundancy:** Use the "Work Completed" sections (3 and 4) from the previous log version to avoid re-suggesting solutions or code for tasks already finished before the current session began.


## 1. Project Overview & Goals:

* **Application:** A feature-rich "LockieMedia Todo App" and an accompanying "Admin Panel".
* **Technology:** Client-side HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript (ES6 Modules), Firebase (Auth & Firestore - Compat SDK v8 style) for backend.
* **Todo App Core:** Task management (CRUD, due dates, priority, labels, notes), feature flag system, modular services. Data stored in Firebase for authenticated users, with local fallbacks.
* **Admin Panel Core:** Separate HTML page (`admin.html`) using the same Firebase backend. Provides insights and monitoring for the Todo App. Includes admin authentication, display of error logs from Firestore, and read-only view of feature flags.
* **Overall Goal:** Develop a robust, feature-complete Todo application with a functional Admin Panel for application monitoring and management insights.

## 2. Current Major Task/Feature Being Worked On:

* **Name:** Admin Panel - Initial Setup & Core Features (with parallel debugging of Todo App)
* **Goal for this Task:** Establish a functional Admin Panel with admin authentication, display of critical application data (error logs, feature flags), and lay the groundwork for user management and overview statistics. Concurrently, address critical bugs in the main Todo App that affect core functionality like feature flag interpretation and UI rendering.
* **Status:** In Progress (Admin login, error log display, feature flag display, and error logging test functionality are functional in Admin Panel. Several critical bugs in Todo App resolved).

## 3. Work Completed (Overall Project - High Level):

* **Todo App (Main Application):**
    * Core task management functionalities implemented.
    * Feature flag system (`featureFlagService.js`, `features.json`) established.
    * Modular architecture with services for logging, events, view management, tasks, projects, labels, etc.
    * Firebase integration for user authentication and data persistence (tasks, projects, preferences, profile with roles) via `firebaseService.js` and `store.js`.
    * Client-side error logging to console and Firestore via `loggingService.js`.
    * Basic UI rendering and event handling structures in place.
    * Critical bug fixes related to feature flag interpretation, UI rendering timing (version display, smart button styling), and module exports implemented.
* **Admin Panel (as part of the current major task):**
    * Initial setup and core features, including enhanced logging and testing capabilities (see Section 4 for details).

## 4. Work Completed (Specific to Current Major Task - "Admin Panel - Initial Setup & Core Features" and Todo App Debugging):

* **Date: 2025-06-02**
    * Created `admin.html` with a basic layout, sections, and an admin login modal.
    * Enhanced `loggingService.js` (in the main app) to send `ERROR` and `CRITICAL` level logs to a new Firestore collection: `app_errors`. User context (UID, email) and client-side info (URL, userAgent) are included in these logs.
    * Modified `featureFlagService.js` to prioritize loading flags from Firestore (`app_config/feature_flags`), with fallbacks to `features.json` and `localStorage`. Added a check to ensure an authenticated user exists before attempting Firestore read for flags.
    * Updated `main.js` (Todo app) to correctly initialize `LoggingService` (log level based on `debugMode` flag) and to ensure proper initialization order with `featureFlagService.js`.
    * Created initial Admin Panel JavaScript files: `admin_main.js`, `adminUI.js`, `adminDataService.js`.
    * Systematically resolved numerous "Cannot access 'LoggingService' before initialization" errors across various modules.
    * Fixed a `TypeError: docSnap.exists is not a function` in `admin_main.js`.
    * Admin login to `admin.html` functional.
    * Admin dashboard displays read-only Feature Flags and Error Logs from Firestore.
* **Date: 2025-06-03 (Previous Session)**
    * Resolved issue where the "Send Test Notification" button in the `DesktopNotificationsFeature` was not working.
    * Fixed issue where the UI version display (e.g., in the footer) did not match the version specified in `version.json`.
    * Addressed issue where smart view filter buttons initially appeared as text-only.
    * Fixed a `SyntaxError` in `modalEventHandlers.js` related to `getAllFeatureFlags`.
* **Date: 2025-06-03 (Current Session)**
    * **Enhanced Logging System & Admin Panel Error Testing:**
        * Updated `loggingService.js` for more comprehensive Firestore log payloads (detailed context, user agent, URL) and robust console logging fallbacks. Added more careful context serialization.
        * Modified `admin_main.js` to correctly initialize `LoggingService` with Firestore for the admin panel context, to properly initialize log levels based on feature flags, and to add a `handleSendTestError` function.
        * Added a "Send Test Error" button to `admin.html`, which triggers the `handleSendTestError` function in `admin_main.js` to send sample ERROR and CRITICAL logs to Firestore.
        * Corrected Firestore security rules for the `app_errors` collection to allow admins to read logs based on the correct path to their role (`users/{uid}/appData/userSpecificData -> profile.role`).
        * Confirmed that the "Send Test Error" button successfully logs errors to Firestore and they are displayed in the Admin Panel.

## 5. Current Focus / Next Steps (Specific to Current Major Task):

* **Current Sub-Task:** Enhanced logging system and added "Send Test Error" functionality to Admin Panel - **Completed.**
* **Immediate Next File/Action:**
    1.  **Review Project Status:** We've made significant progress on debugging the main app and establishing core admin panel functionality, including robust logging.
    2.  **Discuss Next Development Phase:** What would you like to focus on next? Options include:
        * **Further Admin Panel Enhancements:**
            * Implement User Management display (listing users).
            * Develop Overview Statistics display.
            * Refine error log display (e.g., better detail view).
        * **Main Todo App Feature Enablement:**
            * Start enabling features in `features.json` (e.g., `projectFeature`, `subTasksFeature`, `kanbanBoardFeature`) one by one, test their functionality, and refine their implementation.
            * Update the `README.md` to accurately reflect the status of these features as they are enabled and tested.
        * **Address any other pending issues or minor bugs.**
* **Specific questions for AI (if any):**
    * None at this moment.
* **Blockers (if any):**
    * Implementing Admin Panel User Management (beyond basic display) will require careful planning regarding data access and potential changes to Firestore security rules for write operations by admins on user data (if intended).

## 6. Known Issues / Bugs (Related to current work or recently discovered):

* **Resolved (during current or immediately preceding session):**
    * Firestore permission error (`Missing or insufficient permissions`) preventing Admin Panel from reading `app_errors` collection. (Fixed by correcting security rule path to user's role).
    * Desktop Notification test button not working.
    * UI version display mismatching `version.json`.
    * Smart view filter buttons having incorrect initial styling.
    * `SyntaxError` in `modalEventHandlers.js` related to `getAllFeatureFlags`.
* **Minor Warning (Understood/Expected):** `[ProjectsFeature] Cannot populate project filter list. Dependencies missing.` - This occurs because the `projectFeature` is currently disabled in `features.json`.
* **Minor Warning (Understood/Expected):** `[ModalEventHandlers] Element #openFeatureFlagsModalBtn not found.` - This button ID is not present in the `todo.html` markup.

## 7. Future/Pending Work (Overall Project - High Level):

* **Admin Panel:**
    * Flesh out User Management (view details, potentially disable users - requires careful rule changes).
    * Implement all Overview Stats.
    * Implement A/B Testing stats display section.
    * Add more sophisticated filtering/pagination for Error Logs.
    * Improve the "Details" view for individual error logs beyond a simple `alert()`.
* **Todo App (Main Application):**
    * Complete and refine planned features like Calendar View, Pomodoro Timer, Sub-tasks, Task Dependencies, Reminders, File Attachments, etc. (as per `features.json` and README). This involves changing their flags to `true` in `features.json` and testing/refining their implementation.
    * Address any UI/UX improvements.

## 8. Important Notes / Decisions Made:

* Admin role is defined in Firestore at `users/{uid}/appData/userSpecificData` within a `profile` map, as `profile: { role: "admin" }`.
* Feature flags are intended to be read-only in the current iteration of the admin panel (manual changes to Firestore `app_config/feature_flags` or `features.json` still needed for modification by admin, unless `setFeatureFlag` in `featureFlagService.js` is enhanced for admin writes to Firestore, which it now does).
* Error logs are stored in the `app_errors` Firestore collection.
* The project uses the Firebase JavaScript SDK (Compat version - v8 style syntax).
* The Admin Panel is a separate HTML page (`admin.html`) but shares Firebase configuration and some services (logging, feature flags) with the main Todo app.
* `loggingService.js` has been enhanced to send more detailed logs to Firestore for `ERROR` and `CRITICAL` levels.
* A "Send Test Error" button was added to `admin.html` and corresponding logic to `admin_main.js` to test the error logging pipeline.
* Corrected Firestore security rule for `app_errors` to allow admins to read based on the correct path: `get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)/appData/userSpecificData).data.profile.role == 'admin'`.
